# Car Price Predictions

This project focuses on predicting car prices using a combination of rule-based models and a powerful CatBoost model. It involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset, selecting relevant features, building the models, and analyzing their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including their features and corresponding prices. The dataset can be found in the files attached.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, I thoroughly analyzed the dataset to gain insights and understand its structure. The following steps were performed:

1. Loading the dataset: The dataset was imported into the preferred programming environment.

2. Understanding the data: We reviewed the data description, column names, and variable types to gain a high-level understanding of the dataset.

3. Summarizing the data: We calculated summary statistics and generated visualizations to understand the distribution, central tendency, and spread of the variables.

4. Exploring relationships: We investigated relationships between variables, calculated correlations, and visualized associations using scatter plots, heatmaps, or contingency tables.

## Rule-Based Model

Based on the EDA insights, we selected several features to be included in our rule-based model. This model incorporates predefined rules and heuristics to predict car prices.

## CatBoost Model

We also built a powerful CatBoost model, a gradient boosting algorithm specifically designed to handle categorical features effectively. The following steps were performed:

1. Model training: I trained the CatBoost model on the prepared dataset, using appropriate hyperparameters.

2. Model analysis: Conducted cross-validation and feature importance analysis to assess the model's robustness and identify the most influential features.

## Conclusion

In this project, I successfully conducted an EDA analysis of the car price dataset and selected several features for our rule-based model. I also built a powerful CatBoost model and analyzed its performance. The code and documentation provided in this repository can serve as a reference for predicting car prices or similar tasks.

I am only on the start of my DS learning path. :) Please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions for further improvements.
